    <marquee>The rover Curiosity was launched by an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on November 26, 2011, <br>
      and landed in Gale crater on Mars on August 6, 2012. Curiosity is about 3 metres (10 feet) long<br>
       and weighs about 900 kg (2,000 pounds), which makes it the longest and heaviest rover on Mars.<br>
      Here are the images of our new human colony surface sent by the rover.<br>
